# Unessay Project #2:

## Printing a book

#### Jack Nolan

I really wanted to go through the whole process of printing and producing a book for my final project of this class (both as a project for the class and as a personal class). Especially after seeing the artist's books in the Archive lab, I really wanted to come up with some interesting idea for printing. Ever since reading the book *Follow This Thread* by Henry Eliot, I have been thinking about trying to set type in a more interesting / complex way than merely up and down. I figured a book about the Minotaur myth would be ideal for this. So, in trying to design the book, I set the pages which are mainly about the labrynth in a labrynthian fasion. On the center page, I set the text in a truely maze-like fasion. On this page, I took some inspiration from Leah Price's "Interleaf: Please Lay Flat" from *What We Talk About When We Talk About Books* in that the text walks over the gutter from one side of the page to the other and back again. I think it's probably a bit hard to follow if you are looking at it for the first time, but that's probably okay - it fits pretty well into the getting lost in a maze category. Then, on the last spread, I set the text so that it spirals in on the left-hand page and spirals back out on the right hand page. Because these two pages got printed on different sides of the sheet, I couldn't really have the text walk accross the gutter of the book because it would be really hard to align it perfectly, which is pretty important for something like that. Otherwise, I also took inspiration for the tapering at the bottom of the pages of text from one of the books in the Northeastern archive.

Tapering on the bottom of a page from a math/engineering textbook from 1554:

In terms of design, I chose to make the book the size I did was just because I had really nice paper left over from a previous project that I wanted to use on a new book project, otherwise, I'm not sure I would have printed the book like I did with the three spreads stacked on top of eachother, but I guess it still worked pretty well.

For the text, I couldn't find anything that exactly matched what I was looking for that was in the public domain so I ended up writting my own text for this book. This was done by basically collecting all of the original myths I could find, mostly from websites like [this](https://www.theoi.com/Ther/Minotauros.html) which lists a bunch of quotes from classic texts about the Minotaur. Additionally, I found a lot of inspiration from the *House of Asterion*, by Jorge Luis Borges, which I probably would have just directly printed if it were in the public domain.

### Type setting

I started off by setting the title page and the rest of the standard pages of text. The title page already proved a bit of a challenge to get everything to fit snugly.

Next I worked on the center page. I started off by just setting all of the text so that I could move it all around.

Then I started setting the type o nthe page. Since I didn't plan this out on the computer before I started, I pretty much just winged it this point. For some reason, I didn't expect this to take too long; I believe I actually ended up staying on working on this page for around 10 hours straight. Here you can see first line crossing over the gutter of the page (where the 2 EM space is).

By this point in the typesetting process I had realized all of the benefits that working on 12 was giving me, in that each letter was exactly 1 pica tall, which made my math a lot easier. Additionally, its worth pointing out my process a bit better here. First I would look at where I wanted the text to go next. Then, I would try to find the correct length of leading to go in that space. From there, I would look at this line and grab as much type as would fit well into that space. I would then move this type to a job stick and insert spacing material into the line until it fit perfectly. Then, the type would get moved into place and the process would restart.

Tada! It's a complete spread! I really like the zoomed out pictures because you can really see the mess that was involved in setting the pages.

Full compositing progress up to this point.

At this point, I was much better at arranging my text on the page, so this page went much faster. Of course, these pages are much simpler and have much less text than the previous spread, so that helps too. Another thing that helped when setting these pages is that I mostly just stuck with using 6 point leading which was very convinient when using 12 point type.

The last type set for the main pages of the book - the colophon. I thought it would be fun to set this type so that every other line is upside down. It turns out this is harder to read than I thought it would be without flipping the book around which is pretty interesting.

Done Typesetting! These are the two pages arranged and ready to be printed!

### Printing

Aaaaand ..... in the press!

Graveyard of smashed type :(
I forgot to readjust the arms that lift the paper. Sorry about this again! Luckily we had replacement type of the same size
![Smashed type :(](/images/Unessay2Photos/IMG_0807.jpg)

Aaaaand ..... we're back in the press and ready to try again!

Done printing the text! All my stress of dropping my type is finally gone!

**Printing Day #3**

It turns out I actually ended up doing one more day of printing. I wanted to print some labels for the outside of the book. To keep things simple, I printed on the proofing press.

Videos of the printing process can be found [here on my Google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L5bIlkBZEuK7Y2bO8UQg47bFEFY2tcPg?usp=sharing).

### Binding

The binding process started with cutting up all of the paper that I would need into the correct sizes.
![Nicely cut paper and book boards](/images/Unessay2Photos/IMG_0815.jpg)

These will be the spines.
![Spines of the books](/images/Unessay2Photos/IMG_0823.jpg)

All of the labels nicely cut.

For Monday, I decided I wanted to get 8 books fully bound. So I sewed up 8 books.
![Books sewed up](/images/Unessay2Photos/IMG_0833.jpg)

The binding process then basically goes, starting with the spine, attach the spine to a strip of book cloth.
![Spine attached to bookcloth](/images/Unessay2Photos/IMG_0835.jpg)

Then, you attach boards to the ends of the bookcloth.
![Boards attached to bookcloth](/images/Unessay2Photos/IMG_0836.jpg)

Then, you attach paper to the outside of the boards.
![Paper attached to outside of board](/images/Unessay2Photos/IMG_0834.jpg)

Then, you wrap the paper around the edges of the boards. Now you basically have a flat case.

Now, the exciting part happens and the text block goes in. I didn't take any pictures after this step, but all that needs to happen is that the floating endsheets are attached, and then the labels on the outside of the book are attached, and then it's done!

Finally, a bunch of books all get squashed under other books. Basically, they are all just standing in for book presses.

And that's all!
