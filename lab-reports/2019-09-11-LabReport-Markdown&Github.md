# Lab Report: Markdown & Github

#### JACK NOLAN

## Process Description

This lab we set up our Git repositories and started to play with the MultiMarkdown standard, which is an easy, human-readable way to edit text with styling built in. We also set up a Github account if we did not already have one, and generally learned our way around using the website and its accompanying software which lives on the user's computer (Github desktop, or via the command line). Knowing markdown is actually a really helpful general computer skill because it is also used in a lot of chat apps like Discord or Slack.

Clearly, our lab went well because this lab is written in Markdown and hosted by Github. However, I'm not going to lie, as a computer science student, I already had a Github account and generally already knew Markdown, but that doesn't mean I didn't learn new things - like the extended Markdown syntax used by places like Github for making tables or the fact that you can also use HTML tags in a markdown file.

## Observations

As I mentioned in the Process Description, I do already generally know my way around Git at this point in my CS career, but I still always find it exciting to use. I didn't download the Github desktop because I really like typing my commands into the terminal because it kind of makes you feel like an epic hacker or something - really just typing anything on the command line makes you feel that way, so you may as well use it when you can.

Anyway, Markdown is a great way to style text online without having to spend too much time thinking about HTML syntax or anything like that. It is a really well-designed spec in that you can pretty much understand what the styling is without even needing to render it. Two asterisks around a word: \*HELLO\* is already a generally understood way of showing emphasis, so it just makes sense that that should result in an italic word: *HELLO*. Using HTML tags, like `<i>` and `</i>` is just so much less intuitive. A good, user-friendly spec is one that you should not have to think too much about while using it.

## Analysis

One feature of Markdown, which I have already described above, is its ease of use because of the simplicity and intuitive design decisions. This ease of access is massively important because it makes it so much easier to create and publish text online for normal people. This helps improve people's computer and internet literacy. If only the people who sat down and learned HTML could write nicely formatted text for the internet, the internet would be a much less nicely formatted place. Easy drag and drop website builder sites also help in this regard. Anyone should be able to make their own website without too much technical knowledge, from just the point of free speech and free press. Anyone should be able to share their ideas online, even if they have not learned HTML. Simple specs, like Markdown, help democratize the internet, because anyone can use it.

If Markdown can be the media in which you write your book, does Github or your website become your book? If the book is the medium, the container of your thoughts and words, then surely a website could be a book. Like a book, you can flip from page to page of your own free will, explore its contents or its text, read its footnotes, find something to learn or be entertained by. Like a book, it is interactive and you, the user, can affect its form. But, perhaps the website is not a book - it is not a physical thing that cannot be interacted with, and the actual hard drive or SSD which holds the website or Git repository cannot be read by a human alone. The only thing which connects a book to a website is the underlying ideas and purposes of the two medias. They both can be read and explored and interacted with and present some ideas to the reader. Surely that is all that is needed.

The texts and images and videos of websites still run up upon all of the issues which Socrates and the Hesperoe, from *The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species*, had with book in the first place. Books "could not be interrogated like a real person, could not answer its critics or justify its accounts" (Ken Liu), and therefore should not be trusted. While a website could perhaps be updated for a while, answering and justifying, one day its editors will lose interest or die, and no one will be there to update and answer anymore. Then, like a book, it will be frozen in time, unable to reply, perhaps to fall off the internet entirely and be lost forever. Even popular websites may one day no longer be visitable or readable or exist at all, like *The New England Primer*, Described in *What We Talk About When We Talk About Books*. Your story, written in Markdown and living online, may disappear someday in the future when Github closes its doors and the hard drives are erased and your backups fail, just as books may fall apart and get repurposed, and oral tradition may drop some old tales. No knowledge or medium or media is permanent or perfectly accessible. Even carvings in stone will be worn away, their symbolism lost to the sands of time. The internet, and computers in general, have not been around long enough to know what data will be saved in the future, and what will be forgotten to make way for something new. Will your *Twilight* fan-fiction stand the test of time, and live on in some online archive for hundreds of years to come, or will it be forgotten to make way for some newer flashier, more popular fan-fiction? Who knows with the internet; it just has not existed for long enough for any real precedent to be made.

### Some Fun Examples of Markdown

hi

HE**LLOO THERE I** AM _J**A**CK_ 

that _was_ **_pretty_ wild**.

---

* hello
* This is a bullet
    1. This number is in the bullet
    2. So is this one
        1. This one is another layer down!
        3. So is this one!
        57. <-- is actually the number 57 even though it looks like it is the number 3.
    3. Back again
        * bullets again!
          > Now this is a quote.
          This is on the same line in the quote
      
          > `This looks like code`
* bye

Github can even do some extended mark down stuff like the following table:

| The | Title | ! |
| - | - | - |
| The | Content | Of |
| This | Table | Is |
| This | Cool | Sentence |

Neat!
