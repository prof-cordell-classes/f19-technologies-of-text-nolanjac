# Lab Report: Letterpress I: Composition

#### Jack Nolan

## Process Description

This lab was our first week of two working in the letterpress lab. Everyone selected a poem produced by their twitter bot and hand set it. I choose my font to be `18 pt Script`, which I used to set [this tweet](https://twitter.com/TechnologiesBot/status/1176161559565033474). In order to set the type, we used a job stick, and selected each character from the cases of type, called a "California job case". Each case contains a different font of type from the other cases. As I discussed in class, I set my type in the job stick upside-down from how we were taught in class to set our type, I discuss this more in the Observations section of this report. We used 20 pica leading between our rows of type. I managed to set the whole poem during our lab time, and then I rearranged some of it the next time we had time in class. Below are some pictures of the set type, ready to be printed.

Below is all of the type I set during the actual lab day:

On the next Monday, we were able to spend a little bit more time working on our compositions, which allowed me to switch out the I for a Y for the first letter. It looks like I still missed the second letter, which looks like it’s actually a `0` instead of an `o`:

## Observations

Now, I must say, I do have a bit of experience with composing type, so this was not the newest experience for me, but it was still a lot of fun. Last semester, while I was on co-op, I took a class called [Artists Books on the Vandercook](https://pce.massart.edu/section/artists-books-on-the-vandercook-press/) at MassArt because I was particularly interested in letterpress and book making. We learned some book binding and about type setting and printing. However, we printed on a proofing press, which is very different in many ways from the clamshell press at our printing press, so I'm excited to learn more about our press and its operations. Below is a page from my final project:

Anyway, I'm excited to visit Huskiana Press a bit now that there are community printing hours and start working on some project.

What I found most interesting was that in your demonstration of hand setting type, you instructed people to set their type holding the job stick in their right hand with the base of the type facing you so that it runs backward and you set your rows of type towards you. I found this interesting because when I learned hand composition we set type holding the job stick the other way around, so that the tops of the type faces the compositor and you place in type from left to right, like you would normally read it. I believe this a more natural way to go about setting type because you don't have to worry about changing the direction you are reading in, you just need to worry about reading each letter upside-down, which is a skill I think more people can pick up easier than reading from right to left and reading the backwards type. Holding the job stick the other way around just removes a layer of complexity in the whole process. Also, in all of my researches online, the method I learned is the one that is taught, like here at [Letterpress commons](https://letterpresscommons.com/setting-type-by-hand/). I think you should give my method a go and see if you find it easier or harder than your method.

## Analysis

Producing a book by hand-setting all of the type requires an enormous amount of effort. In fact, setting up the book to be printed would almost certainly take more time than handwritting a book, and in some cases could easily twice as much time if not more. It takes a long time and a lot of up-front effort to set up all of the text for a book. And then, you haven't actually produced anything because you still need correctly arrange all of the text blocks and proof them and finally print them. If you were to only print one or two books, you could probably just write the books by hand faster than you could produce them by printing. But, the magic of letterpress is its ability to just keep making copies. The huge initial cost of setting up the book is far outweighed by the ease of producing hundreds of copies. I believe this high startup cost was one thing that was missed by Trithemius in his *In Praise of Scribes* where he states that "[c]opying requires greater diligence." If you are trying to print a book on the same level as a scribed book, the printed book would always take more effort overall. While Trithemius's claim that the "ornamentation of some printed books is often neglected" when compared to the ornamentation of a highly decorated scribed book, this is true. But, you are comparing apples to oranges, one should compare an undecorated scribed book to an undecorated printed book. The trouble is, adding decorations and ornamentation to a book just makes it even more laborious to produce, especially if you are going to add colors. In fact, for a long time, the best way to produce colored illustrations or illustrations with gradients in printed books was to print the black and white outlines on the press and then hand-color the illustrations using stencils.

However, Trithemius's claim that spelling in printed books was often neglected is clearly a false claim (although perhaps not in that period of printing). It was printers, after all, who standardized the spelling for many words in the English language. On the other hand, perhaps this ignoring of the spelling of the original authors and instead following a more standard spelling of words could be considered *neglecting* spelling, but this seems like a bit of a short-sighted view of the matter. It is the difference from preserving the original in exactly the same form as it was when it was created and creating a new copy with ease of consumption in mind. This move towards a better reading experience can also be seen in the move towards using roman typefaces from gothic typefaces, as explored in Amaranth Borsuk's book *The Book*, on page 92. If I knew Latin, I’m sure I would have an easier time of reading *Hypnerotomachia Poliphili* than Guttenberg's bible or any copied book before that. Additionally, *Hypnerotomachia Poliphili* is also a beautifully ornamented book full of woodcut prints, but it certainly lacks the color of any scribed books.

This change from gothic to roman typefaces may have had other ramifications too. In "How typeface influences the way we read and think", Chris Gayomali explores how our experience of reading is subtly affected by reading in different typefaces. At this point in the internet, it is impossible to take anything written in *comic sans* seriously, while *Times New Roman* just shouts essay, or *Helvetica* looks like it comes from a train stop. But our reading may also change due to different typefaces because some typefaces are just harder to read than others. And, as long as your reader doesn't give up on reading, a harder typeface will result in a slower reader, and as a result, a reader who will probably think and analyze the text more as they read. A bible printed in a gothic typeface, might be slower and less enjoyable to read than one printed in a roman typeface, but at the same time you might get more out of reading the gothic bible than the roman one because you can't just speed through it.
