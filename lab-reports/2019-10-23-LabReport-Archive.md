# Lab Report: LAB NAME

#### YOUR NAME

## Process Description

You should begin with _1-2 paragraphs_ outlining precisely what you did in the lab activity. While much in these paragraphs will repeat between students, it is worthwhile to write out your experience, both to help you remember what you did and because your experiences—and what you take away or emphasize—will differ in subtle but important ways from your classmates. Most of our experiential activities will include specific outcomes. You might produce a specific material product, such as a letterpress printed sheet, or be asked to adapt code we went over together to answer a new question. The first task of any lab report, then, will be to demonstrate completion of these tasks.

Your entries may also include pictures taken during a given lab (and in fact many would benefit from such images. Any images you use should be added to the `images` folder in your repository.

## Observations

In the next section of each report, you should in **2-3 paragraphs** move from a literal description of what you did in the lab to a more conceptual set of observations. In brief, you want to home in on those aspects of the lab that raised questions or prompted new insights into the textual technology we investigated in the lab activity. What new ideas occurred to you while working? What surprised, delighted, or frustrated you?

## Analysis

The final section of each report should bring your work in the lab into direct, critical conversation with our readings. In **_3-4 paragraphs_**, you should connect your lab observations to ideas from readings assigned _in the given lab unit_. This prose need not be as formal as a research paper, but it should demonstrate careful thought and preparation. You should integrate the readings explicitly, if possible through direct quotation. Use this writing to experiment with intellectual pairings you think might be generative to your larger thinking and help you prepare for the class’ Unessay projects. Think of your lab reports as an evolving research paper, and take them as seriously as one.

Once I went to the Chicago Public Library's rare book collections, and I ordered a book with a few leaves of uncut edges, specifically an edition of *Moby Dick* printed by the Lakeside Press in 1930. Aside from my own disapointment for all who have come before me, looking upon this book, none have read the whole thing. Indeed, when I asked the librarians about it, they refused to open these last couple of pages, telling me that if I had to read the content of those pages I could find the text online or read those pages from any number of reprints of this edition over the years. But, reading the book online does not contain beautiful design and illustration of the book, at reading later reprints do not give the same experience, for the quality of paper and offset of the ink of the illustrations onto the opposing pages of text. Surely it is the experience of reading the book that matters - not its physicality?
To me, this just reminds me of the books you see behind glass in museums. What is the point of a book if not to be read, if it is impossible to be read? Like the unreadable book of our artists books collection in our museum's archives, can one even consider such a book to be a book. It must be openned to be experienced and read. Can the opening of a book be seen as some sort of choereography of book reading, of an author compelling us to open the book and read in some specific way. If we see a book as a series of physical spaces, each offering their own experiences, like house of rooms all lined up which the reader is left to explore, can we still call this a book? And yet, if we think back to the *The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species*, of the The Tull-Toks who read the stars, surely an unopenable book must be a book? The stars tell tales as they move across the sky and brighten and dim and die. The physical space and experience and meaning changes as time moves on. The meaning can only be spotted on the grandest of timescales. This too for the unopenable book, stuck in the archives, one day to disintegrate as its paper rots and coiled metal binding rusts, and in this action reveal its meaning and stories. Like the book hung out in the weather, where the object of the book tells much more than its content. And isn't that the whole meaning of this class, of the media is the message? The text will fall away, are merely the thoughts of man, but the objects will still reveal their tales over time, as they fall apart. Purhaps pointing to the tale of the universe, of creation and of slow deteration, of the tearing apart of all that is and will be in the ever increasing expansion on the unvierse.
But that is only looking at books in the long run, instead our relatively short bursts of interest in reading a book necessitates the moving from one physical space to another, by turning the page, by exploring the next element. In a couple of lab reports, I have mentioned that one of the key elements of a book is their interactivity, an element wholy neglected by a book stuck inside a glass case, and partially neglected by books with uncut edges. Surely, a book stuck within a case, with only a single spread revealed cannot be considered a book unless you have the key? In any case, a book with uncut edges owned by people who refuse to cut them can only partially be a book, like a house with boarded up, unexplorable rooms. The archivists at the Chicago Public Library were more interested in maintaining their books as artifacts than functional objects, to be looked at merely, not to be explored. Why was I there? To see a fancy book! To ogle its art and be dazzled by its design. I wasn't really there to read it, and that doesn't conflict with our definition of a book.

The act of tearing out each page a book and lighting them on fire is a perfectly acceptible way of "reading" a book, in experiencing each physical page, of searching for meaning in the choreography of exploring the book.
