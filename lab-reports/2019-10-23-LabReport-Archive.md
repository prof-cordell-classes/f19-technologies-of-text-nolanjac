# Lab Report: Into the Archive

#### Jack Nolan

## Process Description

This lab, we went to the archives to look at a collection of historical books and more modern artists books. We explored both of these kinds of collections at our own college's archives in the basement of Snell Library, and also explored historical children’s books at the Massachusetts Historical Society.

At Snell, I failed to photograph any of the artists books, but I did take quite a couple photos of the following beautiful math and engineering textbook, printed in 1554.

At the Massachusetts Historical Society, I also photographed some books, like the following Native American Primer, printed in Algonquian, Call #: E187:

We also saw interesting mixes of text and image in books like the following *Mother Goose in Hieroglyphics*, call #: Box 1849:

## Observations

This lab, we explored a history of printing and book design, from manuscript to letterpress to an artist book built off the interactivity of a computer. Generally though, if you were to squint and look at the books, they would pretty much all look the same. Rectangular blocks of paper covered in ink. This was one area which the artists book generally got my excited. A few of them actually broke this shape, by putting all of the writing on matches, or enclosing the circular inside an unopenable ring. Of course, I'm sure if we had a large enough sample size of books from the manuscript and letterpress eras, we'd also find about the same number of books breaking this convention. Anyway, today most books are still rectangular. This really makes the book feel almost stagnant, and ancient form which hasn't advanced since the scroll. I think this is part of what gets me so excited about the future of books in electronic or online forms. It gives them the opportunity to finally make some advancement in form.

Also, as someone who has been to a few archives before, it was really sad to not be able to fully interact with the books at the Massachusetts Historical Society. I feel like we probably could have gained more from the books themselves in being to explore them more ourselves, to be able to explore their production, their paper, and binding. To be able to really get to know a book, you need to interact with it. You can only gleam the most surface level education in a book by looking at a single spread of its pages. It was always extremely helpful to have the librarians come and flip the pages for us while talking about the books, but it would have been more helpful to be able to explore them ourselves. Of course, I understand why they didn't have us touch the books, but it would have been convenient if they had taken 5 minuets to just give us the "handling old books" spiel or had us sign something so we could touch the books.

## Analysis

I once went to the Chicago Public Library's rare book collections and I ordered a book with a few leaves of uncut edges, specifically an edition of *Moby Dick* printed by the Lakeside Press in 1930. Aside from my own disappointment of all who have come before me, looking upon this book without having even considered reading the whole thing, I wished to see those hidden pages. But, when I asked the librarians about it, they refused to open these last couple of pages, telling me that if I had to read the content of those pages I could find the text online or read those pages from any number of reprints of this edition over the years. But, reading the book online does not contain beautiful design and illustration of the book, at reading later reprints do not give the same experience, for the quality of paper and offset of the ink of the illustrations onto the opposing pages of text. Surely, it is the feeling of each page between the fingers, the imperfections of the original, the whole overarching experience of reading the book that matters?

To me, this just reminds me of the books you see behind glass in museums, or books in archives that you're not allowed to touch. What is the point of a book if not allowed to be read, if it is impossible to be read? Like the unreadable book of our artists books collection in our museum's archives, can one even consider such a book to be a book. It must be opened to be experienced and read. The opening of a book can be seen as some sort of choreography of book reading, between the author and designer and the reader of the book; the author compelling us to open the book and read it and experience it in some specific way. The act of tearing out each page a book and lighting them on fire is a perfectly acceptable way of "reading" a book, like in *Burning Small Fires* by Nauman, in experiencing each physical page, of searching for meaning in the choreography of exploring the book. Who says book burning is not a valid way of learning from the book? It might not be what the book hoped to teach you, but you can still learn from it, experience it. If we see a book as a series of physical spaces, each offering their own experiences, like house of rooms all lined up which the reader is left to explore, can we still call the unreadable book in our archives a book? Yet, if we think back to the *The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species*, of the the Tull-Toks who read the stars, surely an unopenable book must be a book? The stars tell tales as they move across the sky and brighten and dim and die. The physical space and experience and meaning changes as time moves on. The meaning can only be spotted on the grandest of timescales. This too for the unopenable book, stuck in the archives, one day to disintegrate as its paper rots and coiled metal binding rusts, and in this action reveal its meaning and stories. Like Duchamp's *Unhappy Readymade*, a book hung out in the weather to rot, the everchanging object of the book tells much more than its content. And isn't that the whole meaning of this class, of the media is the message? The text will fall away, are merely the thoughts of man, but the objects will still reveal their tales over time, as they fall apart, disintegrate, perhaps pointing to the tale of the universe, of creation and of slow deterioration, of the tearing apart of all that is and will be in the ever increasing expansion on the universe.

But that is only looking at books in the long run, instead our short lives lead to relatively short bursts of interest in reading any book, which necessitates the moving from one physical space to another, by turning the page, by exploring the next element. In a couple of lab reports, I have mentioned that one of the key elements of a book is their interactivity, an element wholly neglected by a book stuck inside a glass case, and partially neglected by books with uncut edges. Surely, a book stuck within a case with only a single spread revealed cannot be considered a book unless you have the key? In any case, a book with uncut edges owned by people who refuse to cut them can only partially be a book, like a house with boarded up, unexplorable rooms. It is a book that is mostly explorable, but partially locked away. The archivists at the Chicago Public Library were more interested in maintaining their books as artifacts than functional objects, to be looked at merely, not to be explored. Why was I there? To see a fancy book! To ogle at its art and be dazzled by its design. I was there to read it by idly flipping through each page, by enjoying each page for its own majestic design and artistic value. This too, is a perfectly acceptable way to read a book.

Of course, there are other ways of reading books too. Books need not be read sequentially but can be read in any order one pleases. This is especially helpful for dictionaries. In "Two Word Books", Gleick follows the publication history of two different dictionaries across two different eras. The first dictionary ever produced, with its words arranged in a most unconservative fashion - alphabetically - and the Oxford English Dictionary - whose goal is to list and categorize all English words across time. These monumental books are not really meant to be read from start to finish, from A to Z. Rather, the designers have choreographed a new dance, to read only snippets of the book in order to get to tell where you are at in the alphabet and to skip forward and backward and check again, iteratively, until you find yourself at your word which you are trying to look up, and then you only read the small snippet of text to gleam the definition of the word before snapping the book shut and hiding it away back up on the shelf. For the dictionary, it would be highly unhelpful to list all of the words chronologically (like when were they first added to the English Language), just as it would be unhelpful to have a history book printed alphabetically. The form matches the function, and each tell the user how best to read the book. Which doesn't make reading each page from front to back an invalid way to read the book - the dance is still up to the reader, no matter what the choreography says.

Note: This lab report was also a bit of a reaction to "Baxter’s Procrustes", especially my feelings on uncut pages, so I guess there may be more where this came from next week.
