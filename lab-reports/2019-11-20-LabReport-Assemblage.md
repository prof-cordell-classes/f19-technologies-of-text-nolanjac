# Lab Report: Zine You Around

#### Jack Nolan

## Process Description

This lab we made small zines! This mostly involved collaging together pages from a large collection of magazines and papers to form cohesive images. Ideally, we could have made a full 8 page zine, but I only managed to put together a single page:

I really wanted to make my zine a collage of both words and images, so I spent some time scanning though all of the text to pick out lines which I felt were interesting. Eventually, I landed on a theme of "light", and so put together all of the quotes including some form of the word "light" in its different forms and connotations, and put them all together on a single page, under the title "Safety Matches". I'm not totally sure what I would do with the rest of the zine, but I'm sure as I kept looking through all of the magazines more phrases would start to jump out at me and grab my inspiration.

## Observations

I'm actually not totally sure if the zine I was making was actually a zine to begin with. From all of the zines I had looked at on Monday, they all contained some portion of new work, some new writing or scribbles or something like that, whereas my creation was solely an amalgamation of other people's work. Of course, I had transformed it by picking out single sentences or fragments but in the end the original words weren't really mine, and of course, my zine wasn't really about anything. It wasn't about myself or rights or anything (except different forms of light, I guess). My zine page fits more into the category of creating zines for the pure joy of creation than anything else.

One of my favorite parts of the lab was when we went around the circle at the end of the lab, where we each shared our own creations. Everyone had made a totally different zine even though we were generally all pulling from the same collection of magazines. What was great about the creation process was that it is really easy to create a zine, even if I was really slow at it.

## Analysis

I'm actually not totally sure if the zine I was making was actually a zine to begin with. From all of the zines I had looked at on Monday, they all contained some portion of new work, some new writing or scribbles or something like that, whereas my creation was solely an amalgamation of other people's writings and art. Of course, I had transformed it by picking out single sentences or fragments but in the end the original words weren't really mine, and of course, my zine wasn't really about anything. It wasn't about myself or rights or anything (except different forms of light, I guess). My zine page feels like it fits better into the category of erasure poetry than the general zine. My goal for the final zine, if I ever get around to finishing it, is to not write my own words but to combine the selected words of others into a single narrative. And in doing so, pull out my own words, my own voice, from the words of others. And in a way, this form of writing fits perhaps most closely with the "retyped" format of erasure poetry (besides the "cut out" style) from Trish Hopkinson's [article on erasure poetry](https://trishhopkinson.com/2018/06/10/6-styles-of-erasure-poetry-guest-blog-post-by-erin-dorney/) because the words loose the form which they originally took on their disparate pages. The words lose their original contexts and placements and now float vaguely on my new page, linked by some new, unrelated context, perhaps unlocking some hidden poem lost in all of the original words.

Thinking back to the artist's books we looked at in the basement of Snell, what is the difference between zines and artist's books? We discussed his briefly in class, but I think there are a lot of similarities. Often, artist's books are produced in small limited editions runs, just like zines. Both are trying to relate some message via the medium of a book, through unique interpretations on the definition of a book, or through unique contents and design. Zines' often scrappy look or design help point to the arguments they are trying to make. Though I have talked much in previous lab reports about the future of books and electronic media and websites being books, both artist's books and zines each thrive on the physicality of their existence; both find their meaning in the exploration and interaction with a physical medium. Receiving a zine is an amazing feeling because they are so personal, but even more so, handmade. To receive a gift, not only written by someone, but carefully and thoughtfully built by that person to enhance their writing as greatly as possible is a special thing. The media of a book is its presentation, and presentation matters. The zine is amazing because not only is its contents personal, but its presentation is personal. It's not some small blip on your screen as your scroll through a website, it's an object that you hold in your hands and lend all of your attention to.

One thing I think we all experienced while in production mode of our own zines was the excitement of creativity, something Pagan Kennedy relates gleefully at the end of Chapter 1, "Back to Pagan" in her books *'Zine*, "It reminded me of when I was a little kid, eight or nine, and I used to make my own books. I had rediscovered the sheer delight of creating something." Making things is really fun and exciting. I love making books so that I can give them away or trade them for other people's books. Although I could never make books at the rate Pagan could using letterpress instead of a copier it means my books merely take a different form; my books are much shorter. But the same love of creation still applies. I guess what I always find interesting in book production, especially in private press books or artist's books is the total sum of time spent on it. I'm interested in the work that was required to produce an object. I may be masochistic or something, but I enjoy the manual labor that goes into typesetting a page because you get to explore the page at a level of detail otherwise unachievable. When you have typeset a page, you know and understanding every letter and space on that page, and that is a beautiful thing. However, you get a similar level of understanding and satisfaction from laying out a zine, in cutting out the words and arranging them on the page along with whatever images you may have on that page. Because you need to manually arrange it, you understand all of the details of the spacing between different text blobs on the page and where you have placed the doodles. You don't get this level of understand, down to the technical sense, everything occurring on a page when you simply read it.
