# Lab Report: Electronic Literature

#### Jack Nolan

## Process Description

For this lab, our final lab of the semester, we used Twine to create interactive literature. Basically, Twine is a simple way to build choose your own adventure stories, but also allows for more complex design and basic coding to allow for more complex storytelling, or gamification.

During our lab time, I managed to lay out the following storyboard, which is more of just an exploration into all of the different ways you can have the same page load different text, often just displaying random words, or revealing and hiding links based on how many times you have visited different pages.

Specifically, I explored the `<<if [proposition]>> ... <<else>> ... <<endif>>` form quite a lot in order to change the links that appeared on the page.
In order to print a random word from a list, I would use `<<print either("thing1", "thing2", ...)>>`. 
Using these together allows for a game which changes quite unexpectedly for the user, which is pretty exciting for a choose your own adventure game.

## Observations

I was really impressed by how easy Twine was to use. Although I think all of our practice writing markdown files has helped up navigate writing weird syntax for graphical displays of text, I think the syntax Twine used made a lot of sense. I also really liked how intuitive it was to see the shape of your story by taking a step back and looking at all the connections. Overall, Twine seems like an excellent way to try to expand coding literacy generally because of its integration of simple programming concepts. It shows how programming is really just another problem-solving tool. If you want your game to only do something if certain conditions have been met, the only easy way to do this is to use some simple programming.

Back in high school, I used to write some really wild (and bad, obviously) choose-your-own-adventure stories on a website called [Choose Your Story](https://chooseyourstory.com/), but using this you could only really make the interactions between pages only so complex. Twine on the other hand allows for extremely complex and interesting interactions between different pages and randomization. This extra power given so simply makes writing weird stories much more engaging than on Choose Your Story. However, all upsides come with downsides, and for Twine, that downside is distribution. The great beauty of Choose Your Story was that you could publish your stories and the website would host them for all to see and read, resulting in lots of random people actually playing the game and leaving lots of feedback about how confusing your verbal vomit of a story was. For Twine, this extremely simple, streamlined publication method does not exist. This does mean that it could be possible to sell your Twine based games though, which would have been impossible with Choose Your Story.

## Analysis

Sure, choose your own story books exist in the physical space, but the kind of stories produced by Twine would certainly live better in the digital realm. These are books designed to be read electronically because of their embedded computer code allowing for richer, deeper stories to be told. These books almost feel more like video games then they do books. Indeed, I have long felt that playing a video game was a much closer experience to reading a book than watching a movie. Of course, some video games, like visual novels, or point and click adventure games (or choose your own adventure stories) are basically just books dressed up and presented electronically. But even less directly narrative based games, your Mario Karts, or Minecrafts, or first-person shooter games, are still books because of their interactivity. What makes a game great is that the interactivity is just so much higher than in your average book. If you are on Netflix, the interactivity is at a minimum (especially when the next episode starts auto playing), but still I could still argue that a TV show is a book (As I'm sure I have already argued in a previous lab report)

I think the main problem Craig Mod, writer of "Digital reading," has with Ebooks is just their often lack interesting, or even good design. All Kindle books look the same and act the same. Designers cannot do anything weird or interesting with their books because they are all so standardized. The main problem here is that books specifically designed to be read electronically simply do not work on the Kindle. This is not a problem with the electronic media, it is a problem with the Kindle. Our Twine stories would not work on the kindle, nor would Jon Bois' "What Football Will Look Like in the Future".

And what makes well designed electronic literature anyway? It seems like there are two main directions to go. First the twine route, more interactivity with the readers and how they affect the story. This can be as contained as a choose your own adventure story, to something as wild as [A Universe Explodes](https://a-universe-explodes.com/) a blockchain based book, where readers can modify the book for all future readers. The core idea about the design of these books is in their interactivity, importantly, in ways that it would very difficult to impossible to achieve with physical books. The second route follows more closely with that of "What Football Will Look Like in the Future". The power of the computer is that it is the synthesis of so many other media into a single medium. There is no other media which can mix text and image and animation and sound and video all together in such a uniquely explorable and interactive way. Jon Bois' story does not have branching paths or anything like that, but it is interactive in the sense that the reader must interact with so many different types of media. Of course, the design work for this book would likewise not work on a Kindle.
