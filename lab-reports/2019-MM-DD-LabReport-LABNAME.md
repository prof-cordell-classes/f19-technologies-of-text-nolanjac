# Lab Report: LAB NAME

#### YOUR NAME

## Process Description

You should begin with _1-2 paragraphs_ outlining precisely what you did in the lab activity. While much in these paragraphs will repeat between students, it is worthwhile to write out your experience, both to help you remember what you did and because your experiences—and what you take away or emphasize—will differ in subtle but important ways from your classmates. Most of our experiential activities will include specific outcomes. You might produce a specific material product, such as a letterpress printed sheet, or be asked to adapt code we went over together to answer a new question. The first task of any lab report, then, will be to demonstrate completion of these tasks.

Your entries may also include pictures taken during a given lab (and in fact many would benefit from such images. Any images you use should be added to the `images` folder in your repository.

## Observations

In the next section of each report, you should in **2-3 paragraphs** move from a literal description of what you did in the lab to a more conceptual set of observations. In brief, you want to home in on those aspects of the lab that raised questions or prompted new insights into the textual technology we investigated in the lab activity. What new ideas occurred to you while working? What surprised, delighted, or frustrated you?

## Analysis

The final section of each report should bring your work in the lab into direct, critical conversation with our readings. In **_3-4 paragraphs_**, you should connect your lab observations to ideas from readings assigned _in the given lab unit_. This prose need not be as formal as a research paper, but it should demonstrate careful thought and preparation. You should integrate the readings explicitly, if possible through direct quotation. Use this writing to experiment with intellectual pairings you think might be generative to your larger thinking and help you prepare for the class’ Unessay projects. Think of your lab reports as an evolving research paper, and take them as seriously as one.
