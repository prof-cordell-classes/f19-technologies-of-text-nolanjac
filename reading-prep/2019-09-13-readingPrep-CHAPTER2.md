# Reading Prep: Chapter 2 - Literacy

#### Jack Nolan

## Questions or Observations

1. If the media is the message, is the translation the message? How does a translation affect how we consume that media? It is impossible to translate a text perfectly into another language, so how does this change our realtionship with the original? Also, it is interesting that Alefric should say that a translation looses some of the "spirituality" - or originality ad correctness - of the original, which is a funny thing to say about translating the bible from latin to english, when the latin bible is a translation from the original ancient hebrew.
2. Speech sounds - a world in which people loose different forms of literacy. Oral and written literacy are lost by many. One of the things which makes us human is our ability to communciate, to express complex ideas to one another, something which was mostly lost in the simple hand gensturing to one another that was left after the disease. This is why our protagonist, Valerie Rye is happiest at the end of the story, yes because she now has some purpose in life, but also because she has found people to communicate with easily and fluently. 
3. Programming literacy is still highly different from reading and writing literacy in that it is so diverse / clumsy to work with. Is programming yet in a state in which it should become a literacy? Or is there still important development to go? I'm not so sure coding is at that point of the 26 letter alphabet printed neatly on a page, which reading and writing are currently at. Will the process of becoming a literacy, help insight those changes that are still so needed?
    1. Side note on coding literacy - Do we think one day people will open up a program like they open up novels to read nowadays? Just to relish all of the good programming that those before us have done? Will a good sorting algorithm send shivers down our spine, like reading Moby Dick or something?
