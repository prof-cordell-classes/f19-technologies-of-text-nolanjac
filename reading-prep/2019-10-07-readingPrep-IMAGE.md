## Questions or Observations

1. What separates the production of an artist book as an art form from the general craft of bookmaking?
2. *The Book*, Page 145 - middle paragraph - books have evolved for hundreds of years. Who is to say that “bookworks” are the last iteration on their design before falling out of existence? This seems more like an inflated ego than some kind of logical thought, especially when “bookwork” books or “artist books” are only a tiny portion of the books getting produced or read today when there are millions of other books, like notebooks, used all the time by people.
3. Our twitter bots were essentially modern verions of *Cent Mille Millards* - the book of sonnets of identical rhyming structures whose lines of text can be swapped amongst eachother.
