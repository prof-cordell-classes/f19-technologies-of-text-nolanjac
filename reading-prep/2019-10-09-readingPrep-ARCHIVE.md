## Questions or Observations

1. *Weâ€™re Taking the Genius of Sequoyah into This Century* states that "Sequoyan, in its original manuscript form, had no relationship whatsoever to English or to the Roman alphabet. Only when it moved from script to print did it take on an order and apparent relation to the alphabet". Was this so that printers didn't have to make so many modifications to their printing process in order to print Cherokee? Looking at the chart at the beginning of the text, it seems like the printers would probably still need to have a collection of special type cut. Does the printing process differ greatly when setting up a page of English or Cherokee (or really any other language)?
2. From *How the Page Matters*, I guess I had never considered the whitespace on a page to be most useful for a silent reader, rather than one reading the text aloud. I guess reading a text aloud forces you to follow grammar rules and normal speech patterns whereas you need to enforce those when reading in your head - and the best way to do this is by forcing you to take a break between each word, to line, to page.
3. From *Two Word Books*, "Some men seek so far for outlandish English, that they forget altogether their mothers language, so that if some of their mothers were alive, they were not able to tell, or understand what they say" makes me think of Shakespeare and the like - just making up a bunch of new phrases and words. I guess lots of people were doing this all the time, and the words which other people started to also use eventually are the ones which migrated into the English language.
    a. In some sense the explosive growth of the English language as marked by the OED matches the explosive growth of English speakers, yet I could not imagine that the total vocabulary of the 1600 was merely 60,000 words. Just like we have dozens of words to describe all of the trifles of our lives and societies, so too did the people of the past - those words just may not have been written down and have been lost to the sands of time.
