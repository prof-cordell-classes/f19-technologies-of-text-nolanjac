# Reading Prep: Chapter 8 - Sensation

## Questions or Observations

1. *The End of Books* - I love listenning to audiobooks. I have my favorite narrators who I seek out if I am looking for recording of a book. Today there are "Certain Narrators will be sought out for their fine address, their contagious sympathy, their thrilling warmth, and the perfect accuracy, the fine punctuation of their voice", just look up the Audie Award, who award the best audiobooks and narrators of the year, or lists like AudioFile magazines's list of "golden voices". Of course, the difference here is that these are often not works written by the authors specifically for audio form, they are written books first and formost, designed and written in book form, rather than audio form. They are not as pure as an entirely audio production.
2. There is some power to being able to listen to an interview over being able to read an interview. In listenning to a radio broadcast of an interview, or watching some video recording of an interview makes it harder for that interview to be edited. There is also an immediacy of these formats which is lost in print, of actually getting to witness the discussion rather than hearing some first-hand account of it.
    1. Inventions like the radio make a lot of Uzanne's future of books much easier, it removes all of the logistics of moving the cylinder books around. Of course, you don't get the exact control over playback of the contents of radio as you would get by using your own cylinder player.
3. *99% invisible* -  I have never really understood the conservative arguments against reading a book via audiobook. I know I, at least, often have a little voice in my head when I read, making reading not that different from listenning to an audiobook anyway. It seems to me that humans are much more evolutionarily prepared to grasp the understanding of books in audio form rather than visual form anyway because that's how people have been communicating for that last hundreds of thousands of years. People are hardwired to listen to stories.
