## Questions or Observations

All About *Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage*:

1. pg. 25 - I find the separation of software and hardware so early on to be fascinating. That assuming the hardware does not do anything too unexpected, you can write software for the imaginary machine. This is kind of like writing programs for Turing machines, which are purely imaginary and can't actually be fully built in the real world. Even though they are just a theoretical machine, people still write programs for them, and try to imagine using them for solving problems.
2. pg. 80 - The best way to prove that something is useful is to have to do something which can be immediately understood by the other person. Although, having a machine which can draw some infinite series of cats would be helpful in *Taking over the World!!!* I don't know. Indeed, in its massive and constant jamming, I'm not sure the difference or analytical engines would actually be much use to a task like taking over the world. I guess like modern computers, its invention would probably mostly inspire the creation of better mechanical computers rather than be all that helpful in itself.
3. pg. 201 - The benefits of writing on a computer are so great over that of writing a manuscript that it seems somewhat amazing to me that we should have ever had any books ever completed. A single manuscript, written by the author must be such a transient object, difficult to edit and easily destroyed. Indeed, with all of the steps some manuscript must take before getting printed, it seems astonishing to me that many authors didn't write always write backup copies of their manuscript as they wrote so that if any bits were lost, they could be put back together.
