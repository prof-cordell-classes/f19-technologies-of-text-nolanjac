# Reading Prep: Chapter 12 - Memory

#### Jack Nolan

## Questions or Observations

1. Future reading - This kind of comes back to the idea that we have had thousands of years of invoation and design work done on the physical book, but that the digital book has only existed for a few short years. There has been a huge amount of innovation in the field in the last 60 or 70 years that ebooks have existed, and hopefully more innovation will come. But, of course, the way most digital books are stored, putting together really well designed digital books is really hard, because all of the books just follow the same format. Whereas the physical books must be of the design that the book was originally intended to fill, because it is not liquid.
2. What Football will Look like in the Future - Obviously, this text does something that would be impossible to do in any non-digital format - mixing moving image in gif and video form with text. I like that the videos follow generally the same format of the rest of the text, so that everything flows seemlessly from one medium to another. None of the text is arranged like a regular book, all of the formatting is significant, from the different colors for different speakers to where their speech begins on the page - all of it succesfully helps add to the narrative and to your enjoyment of the story.
3. Interestingly, SB Nation has quite a few videos about silly games and stuff like that on their channel, much like "Garbage Football" (Page, Arizona or Denver, Colorado) is very similar to SB Nation's "Weird Rules" show. I don't follow or really care that much about sports at all, but I still kind of love this show. I'm not really even sure why.
